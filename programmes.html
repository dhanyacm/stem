					<p>
						Our workshops help our participant teachers enhance and energize their current curriculum to include the elements of STEM. With our expertise and experience we analyse the current curriculum of the respective schools and help the teachers to redesign it to make it interdisciplinary, problem based, project based and inquiry based, which are the main elements of a STEM lesson.

​

The key to great STEM education is a curriculum that supports a transdisciplinary instruction and learning. In transdisciplinary instruction, learners are active participants who use problem-solving processes and the powerful critical thinking and exploration practices commonly used in effective STEM classrooms to:

Connect it to the real world

Collaborate with their peers

Arrive at logical conclusions

Explore and think about the careers of individuals who study similar problems

Wisely choose a career of their interest

​

We also train our teachers to create models using  the wide range of kits available with us and design and create new ones catering to the curriculum needs.
