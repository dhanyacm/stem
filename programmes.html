				Our workshops help our participant teachers enhance and energize their current curriculum to include the elements of STEM. <br><br>
				With our expertise and experience we analyse the current curriculum of the respective schools and help the teachers to redesign it to make it interdisciplinary, problem based, project based and inquiry based, which are the main elements of a STEM lesson. ​ <br><br>
				The key to great STEM education is a curriculum that supports a transdisciplinary instruction and learning. In transdisciplinary instruction, learners are active participants who use problem-solving processes and the powerful critical thinking and exploration practices commonly used in effective STEM classrooms to: <br><br>
				<b>Connect it to the real world <br>
				Collaborate with their peers <br>
				Arrive at logical conclusions <br>
				Explore and think about the careers of individuals who study similar problems <br>
				Wisely choose a career of their interest
				</b>
				<br><br>
				We also train our teachers to create models using the wide range of kits available with us and design and create new ones catering to the curriculum needs.

				<h4><b>Junior Engineer Program</b>  <br><br> </h4>
            	<p><br><br>
						
						Global Aero-Sports is the first to launch unique and exciting STEM based
						Program for school kids in the grades 6-12 which includes” Aero Modelling,
						Model Rocketry and Robotics”. This is a 30 Hour hands On program where we
						teach you the fundamentals of these exciting Hobbies so that you can
						successfully make an Airplane Model that flies, A Rocket Model that launches
						into the sky to 800 feet with a WHOOSH! and make Robotic Device like a
						“Line Follower, Obstacle Avoidance Robot” etc. We hope that this will give
						the students to get excited about a career in Engineering or Science. The
						feedback from “Students, Teachers and Parents” has been outstanding over
						the past three years. The MK Letha Memorial Public School, Konni, Kerala has
						had the program for three years now. You can see the positive changes in the
						Kids after attending our classes. They are more creative, more enthusiastic,
						more communicative, more confident and eager to face competition. They
						also develop a clearer vision of their career path. ​ <br><br>

				<h4><b>Senior Engineer Program</b><br><br></h4>				
				<p><br><br>
						Once the students complete the Junior Engineer Foundation Program they
						will be admitted to the Senior Engineer Program. Here they work in Teams on
						real life Engineering Projects like “Hi Altitude Rocketry, Communication
						Electronics, Radio Controlled Drones and various Robotic Applications”. The
						goal is to build “Leadership Skills, Communication Skills, Confidence Building,
						Project Management Skills etc. There is no dearth to the equipment and
						challenges we can provide.<br><br>

						Our Trainers are Skilled and Experienced Engineering Graduates who love to
						Teach. Even Schools in the UAE and USA have approached us to conduct this
						Program. We treat the students as Adults. We trust them to make use of the
						Lab freely and give them complete freedom to work on various Engineering
						Projects. Global Aero-Sports rewards those students who have been able to
						develop new products or new ways of doing things in Aero Modelling,
						Rocketry and Robotics. They also get to meet children of their age from “USA,
						France, Germany, Brazil and Czech Republic”. The Students are also
						encouraged to take part in various Science and Innovation Competitions. ​ <br><br>
