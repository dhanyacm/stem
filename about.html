			<b><font size=4>STEM education</font></b> curriculum, is based on the idea of educating students in four specific
disciplines — Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths as an applied and interdisciplinary
approach <br><br>

<b><font size=4 color="red">S</font><font size=4>cience</font></b> - It is the study of the natural world.<br>

<b><font size=4 color="blue">T</font><font size=4>echnology</font></b> - It is related to any product made by humans to meet a want or need.<br>

<b><font size=4 color="green">E</font><font size=4>ngineering</font></b> - It’s the design process used to solve problems.<br>

<b><font size=4 color="purple">M</font><font size=4>athematics</font></b> - It is the language of numbers, shapes, and quantities which seems to be
irrelevant to many students.<br>
					
STEM teaching is just not about grouping of subject areas but it helps to develop the deep
mathematical and scientific ability, students required to compete in the next century
workforce.<br>

STEM methods along with preparing students for specific jobs It also develops
uniqueness in thinking, reasoning, teamwork, investigative, and creative skills that
students can use in all areas of their lives. <br>				

STEM Learning Academy’s objective is to intentionally incorporate different subjects
across an existing curriculum to make teaching less time consuming, easy, and exciting.
